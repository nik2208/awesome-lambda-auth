package contract

// The capability registry: one contiguous region per capability, each holding
// the name cases gate on, the stage its probe belongs to, and the probe itself.
// harness_test.go enumerates none of them — the probe order, the names
// AWESOME_AUTH_CONTRACT_REQUIRE accepts and the report are all derived from what
// is registered here.
//
// Adding a capability is adding one region, here or in a file of its own, and
// touching nothing else. That is the point: every block after this one adds one,
// and before the registry existed each of them would have edited the same two
// hand-maintained lists and the same probe body.
//
// Two rules a new region has to respect, both of them properties the probes had
// when they were a single block and neither of them expressible in the type:
//
//   - Pick the stage, not the neighbours. Order within a stage is registration
//     order, which across files is file-name order, so a probe that depends on
//     another probe having run is a probe in the wrong stage.
//   - Say which client, and why. p.Anon and p.LoggedIn(t) are different
//     identities and the difference is observable: a route probed with the wrong
//     one can report a capability that is really an authorisation result. Every
//     probe below argues its choice, and a new one is expected to.

//
//   - A name declared twice: the second probe's answer overwrites the first's,
//     so whichever is registered later decides, and which that is depends on
//     file names.
//   - More or less than one stageProvision declaration: the account the rest of
//     the pass runs on is provisioned exactly once, by the probe that is also
//     allowed to stand the suite down.
//   - A case needing a name nobody registered: an unprobed capability is the
//     zero capState, which is capOn, so the case runs against a deployment
//     nothing looked at — the exact failure the three-way capState exists to
