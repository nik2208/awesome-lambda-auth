// The hosted UI, black-box: the config document its pages boot from, and the
// server-rendered pages themselves.
//
// The reference mounts one router at <prefix>/ui (auth.router.ts:1640) whose
// four layers run in an order that is itself behaviour (src/router/ui.router.ts):
// /config answers first, the headless short-circuit returns before the uploaded
// assets are mounted, the SSR catch-all runs before the static serve — which is
// the only reason an extensionless /login is a page and /base.css is a file.
// This port mounts the same router as one handler, because a catch-all sibling
// of a fixed path is not something every Go router will register.
//
// Every case here fetches with no credential of any kind, and that is the
// assertion rather than the convenience: the login page is fetched before any
// session exists, so a deployment that had put the UI behind one would be
// serving a page nobody can reach, and a suite that arrived with a session would
// report it healthy.
//
// Two things are deliberately not asserted, both for the reason the docs cases
// leave out their Content-Security-Policy: the identical assertions run against
// the reference Express app, so anything this port adds belongs in the unit
// tests of the code that adds it.
//
//   - `Cache-Control: no-store` on GET <prefix>/ui/config. That header is the
//     port's own addition (adapter/nethttp/ui.go says so in as many words); the
//     reference sets none on that route. The SSR pages' no-store IS the
//     reference's (ui.router.ts:284) and is asserted below.
//   - The escaping of the injected __AUTH_CONFIG__ object. Go's encoder writes
//     `<` where JSON.stringify writes `<`, which is the registered upstream
//     deviation ui-ssr-config-json-is-html-escaped — the one place the port is
//     stricter than the reference. The bytes differ; the value JSON.parse yields
//     does not, so every case below parses the object rather than matching it.

// uiInjectedConfigMarker is what serveSsrHtml writes into every rendered page
// ahead of the config object (ui.router.ts:273). It is the anchor the pages'
// own scripts read, so a page that has lost it boots by fetching /ui/config
// instead — slower, and with a flash of unstyled content — while still
// answering 200.
