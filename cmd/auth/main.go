// Command auth is the Lambda entrypoint for awesome-lambda-auth.
//
// It composes four things and adds nothing of its own to the auth surface: the
// declarative configuration (internal/config), the DynamoDB stores
// (internal/store/dynamodb), the imported auth core
// (github.com/nik2208/awesome-go-auth and its net/http adapter) and the event
// normalisation layer (internal/lambdahttp).
//
// # Cold start versus request
//
// Everything expensive happens once, in New, before lambda.Start is reached:
// reading and validating the configuration document, resolving secrets,
// building the AWS client and its connection pool, constructing the store, the
// auth core and the routing table. The per-invocation path attaches a request
// id and dispatches. See the App type for why that split is a correctness
// property and not only a performance one.
//
// # Failing to start
//
// A configuration the loader refuses aborts the init with a non-zero exit,
// which the Lambda service reports as an init failure. That is deliberate: a
// refuse-to-start rule that surfaced as a 500 per request would look like an
// outage instead of a bad deployment, and would keep serving the routes that
// happened not to touch the broken knob.
//
// # Routes
//
// The auth routes come entirely from the imported adapter — this binary must
// never add one, because a route that exists here and not in the other family
// ports is a wire divergence by construction. The only local route is
// GET /healthz, which answers from memory.
