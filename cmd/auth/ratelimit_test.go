// The behaviour this block introduces is a behaviour an unconfigured deployment
// has: `rateLimit.enabled` defaults to true, the default scope is the five
// credential flows and the default budget is ten per minute per address. That is
// precisely what the wire deviation rate-limited-routes-answer-429 claims, so
// pinning it against a hand-tuned configuration would test a deployment nobody
// runs and leave the claim itself unpinned. It also means these tests fail the
// day someone changes a default without changing the register, which is the
// tripwire worth having.
//
// The knobs are exercised instead where they can be without a document —
// resolveRateLimit and newRateLimiter take a *config.Config directly — so no
// test here has to configure the block through the schema and trip the phase
// gate that the last commit of this branch removes.
