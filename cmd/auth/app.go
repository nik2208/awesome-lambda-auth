// httpConfig maps the cookie, CSRF and prefix knobs onto the shared wire layer.

// carries when an operator changes security.jwt.accessTokenTtl. The cookie
// *name* prefix is likewise derived by the core (CookieOptions.CookieName) and
// is not a knob in either layer.
//
// UI is the whole `ui` block, and it is the one field here that changes two
// surfaces at once. UIOptions.Enabled makes the adapter register a handler for
// the entire <prefix>/ui subtree — the config document, the SSR pages, the
// assets — and it is also what points every emailed link at
// <site><prefix>/ui/<path>, the hosted UI's page for it, instead of at the bare
// API route (UILink, buildUiLink, auth.router.ts:261-271). The two have followed
// one another since P2 precisely so they could not drift apart on the day the UI
// landed, which is this one. ui.go builds the value.
//
// **The deprecated alias is deliberately not set.** HTTPConfig.UIEnabled is the
// older spelling of UI.Enabled, from when the flag decided nothing but the shape
// of a link, and the core treats the two as one switch: resolve() sets both from
// either, uiEnabled() reads both, and an adapter mounts on UI.Enabled. This
// function used to set the alias and now sets the field it was renamed to, which
// is the one arrangement in which the two cannot be assigned from different
// expressions and come to disagree. A caller holding an *unresolved* config —
// delivery.go, which asks it for UILink — is unaffected, because UILink is one
// of the callers that reads both.
//
// Docs is where the whole documentation surface lives: the two routes the
// adapter mounts under it are the entirety of what the `docs` block does, which
// is why that block fills no core option slot. docs.go builds the value — it is
// the one field here that is not a straight copy, because `docs.swagger` is
// three-valued and DocsOptions.Enabled is a bool.
//
// RateLimiter is the one field of HTTPConfig this function deliberately leaves
// nil, and the reason is that it is not a function of the document. It is a
// middleware constructor closing over a shared counter and an in-process table,
// so building it needs the store the composition root opened, which this
// function does not have and should not take — half a dozen callers here want
// nothing but Prefix() or UILink(). mountAuthSurface takes it as a parameter and
// sets it on the way to the adapter, which is the only place it is read
// (ratelimit.go, idp.go). A nil RateLimiter is exactly "no limiter" to the core,
// which composes a pass-through for it, so the omission is also the correct
// value for every caller that is not mounting.

// rotates an SMS gateway password and sees nothing change has no way to learn
// from the outside that the password was never used. So each one is named, with
// its path, in the cold-start log.
//
// Note in particular what happens to sms.username and sms.password. The schema
// models them as secrets and its own comment says the transport "must move them
// off the URL" because the reference appends them as query parameters on a GET,
// writing credentials into every access log between here and the gateway. An
// SNS sender does not move them off the URL — it has no URL. The credentials-in-
// URL hazard is gone, and so is any use for the credentials.
//
// The gaps are reported whether or not the block they belong to is switched on,
// and the second case is the one that needs saying out loud. A credential is the
// part of these blocks that lives in Secrets Manager, so it is the part an
// operator sets first and the part a stack template carries; the switch — a from
// address for mail, an endpoint for SMS — is the part that is easy to forget.
// Set the credential alone and internal/config sees nothing to validate (a
// Secret resolved from its plain environment variable leaves no reference in the
// tree for validateSMS's `configured` to find), mailConfigured and smsConfigured
// are both false, and delivery is off. Before this port wired the two blocks
// that combination was refused outright by the phase gap, whose secretPrefix
// covered exactly these paths. Removing the domains removed that cover too, so
// the report has to replace it, or an SMS gateway password in the environment
