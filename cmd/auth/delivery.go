// Credential delivery: how a minted magic link, reset token, verification
// token, email-change token or SMS code leaves this deployment.
//
// awesome-go-auth (v0.4.0) exposes five senders as func types on its Config,
// each wired by a With*Sender option that rejects nil, plus a sixth for the
// notice /change-email/confirm mails to the address an account moved away
// from. This file turns three blocks of configuration into those functions,
// and nothing else in the binary knows that mail is SES, that a text message
// is SNS, or that a delivery webhook exists.
//
// ── which sender ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// email.deliveryWebhook.url, when set, is THE sender for the five credential
// seams: every minted credential is POSTed, signed, to that receiver and
// nothing goes through SES or SNS for those routes (decision D-11). It replaces
// the reference's five send-callback functions, which are in-process code a
// configuration document cannot express (config-schema.md §3.8), and it is what
// a deployment whose transport is neither mail nor SMS — or is not reachable
// from a Lambda — wires. The mailer and sms blocks then cover only what the
// webhook has no seam for: the email-changed notice and the OAuth link-token
// mail, both of which still go through the mailer when one is configured.
//
// Without a webhook, the mailer block selects SES for the four mail seams and
// the notice, and the sms block selects SNS for the fifth.
//
// ── transports or closures ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Upstream offers both: write five closures, or implement the two one-method
// transport interfaces (auth.MailerTransport, auth.SMSTransport) and let the
// ready-made bridges — MagicLinkMailer, PasswordResetMailer,
// EmailVerificationMailer, EmailChangeMailer, SMSTransportSender — do the rest.
// This port implements the transports, for three reasons:
//
//  1. Four of the five mail senders differ only in a template name and a URL
//     builder. Five closures would restate that mapping five times here, and
//     upstream itself factored TokenMailer out of exactly that duplication —
//     copying it back into a downstream port is how a template name or a
//     Content-Type quietly drifts from the rest of the family.
//  2. The URL shapes are upstream's to own. MagicLinkURL, PasswordResetURL,
//     EmailVerificationURL and EmailChangeConfirmURL are the links the verify
//     routes and the shipped clients expect; a closure that built them here
//     would be a second definition of a wire detail, free to diverge.
//  3. auth.MailerTransport is precisely SES's job description — put this
//     rendered message on the wire — and auth.SMSTransport is precisely SNS's.
//     Neither transport has to know what a magic link is, so neither does.
//
// The one thing a bridge cannot do is the OAuth link token, whose URL upstream
// builds itself and hands over ready-made; that one is a closure, below, and it
// still renders through the same templater.
//
// ── where a link points ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Every bridge mailer takes a static BaseURL, but since v0.4.0 the adapters
// resolve the base per request — the request's Origin or Referer when it is
// allowlisted, else the canonical site URL — and put it on the delivery as
// LinkBase, which wins over the static base. The static one is therefore the
// fallback for a service called outside a request, and it is built from the
// same canonical site URL (siteURLs, email.go) and the same HTTPConfig.UILink
// shape the adapters use, so the two can never disagree about a link.
//
// ── what an unconfigured deployment does ─────────────────────────────────────
//
// Nothing changes, and that is deliberate rather than incidental. With no
// email.mailer block the four mail senders stay nil, so POST /magic-link/send
// answers 500 EMAIL_NOT_CONFIGURED while /forgot-password,
// /send-verification-email and /change-email/request answer 200 and mail
// nothing. With no sms block POST /sms/send answers 500 SMS_NOT_CONFIGURED.
// That split is the reference's own — its magic-link strategy checks the email
// configuration up front and throws, its three token routes check nothing and
// succeed silently (wire-contract §2, "if neither exists, no email is sent and
// the route still succeeds") — and reproducing it is the whole point of being a
// port. It is also the safer half of the two: the routes that stay silent mint
// a token that is unguessable, single-use and expiring, so an undelivered one
// costs the caller a mail that never arrives and nothing else.
//
// What this port must NOT do is invent a third behaviour, such as refusing to
// start without a mailer. A deployment serving bearer clients that never touch
// a passwordless route is legitimate, and upstream's Config.validate agrees: it
// does not ask for a sender either.

// delivery holds the transports a cold start could build, plus everything the
// upstream mailers need to render with. A nil transport means "this deployment
// did not configure that half", and every use of it is gated on that.
