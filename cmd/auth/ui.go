// The hosted UI: everything under GET <prefix>/ui — the config document, the
// server-rendered pages, the static assets — built out of the product's `ui`
// block.
//
// Nothing in this file mounts a route, and that is the same absolute rule the
// documentation surface follows (docs.go): every path under the api prefix
// belongs to the imported adapter. Until v0.7.0 this binary mounted four OIDC
// endpoints of its own, the adapter took them over, and the duplicate
// registration killed the cold start inside http.ServeMux. What this file does
// is build auth.UIOptions out of `ui.*`, decide what a Lambda can put behind the
// two filesystem seams, refuse the one configuration that would come up serving
// nothing, and say at cold start which of those happened.
//
// ── what the core gives us, and where it puts it ─────────────────────────────
//
// awesome-go-auth v0.9.0 vendors the reference's own fourteen browser assets
// byte for byte (ui_upstream.go, pinned by sha256 against
// UpstreamUIAssetCommit) and serves the whole of the reference's ui.router.ts
// from one handler, (*Auth).UIHandler, which every adapter mounts at
// <prefix>/ui under HTTPConfig.UI.Enabled (adapter/nethttp/nethttp.go:126-131;
// the reference's own gate is auth.router.ts:1639-1648). Inside that handler,
// in the reference's order, are the config document, the headless
// short-circuit, the uploaded assets, the SSR catch-all with its page mapping
// and three fallbacks, and the static serve underneath.
//
// **`<prefix>/ui/config` is no longer a route of its own on any adapter.**
// v0.7.0 mounted it; v0.9.0 moved it inside UIHandler, which is where the
// reference has it — ui.router.ts:165 is a route inside the router
// auth.router.ts:1640 mounts at /ui. Same document, same `Cache-Control:
// no-store`, same CSRF wrapper. That matters here only because it is the reason
// there is nothing to register: the whole surface is one mount the adapter makes
// from one bool.
//
// ── this block fills no core option slot, and that is a decision ─────────────
//
// The `ui` slot in coreOptionSets stays empty, for exactly the reason `docs`
// does. There is no auth.Option for any knob in this block: the branding, the
// headless flag, the language default and both filesystem seams reach the core
// through HTTPConfig.UI, which the adapter reads at mount time, and the two
// stores the document is actually built from — the settings store and the
// template store — were handed over by other blocks long before this one
// existed. Filling the slot would mean inventing an option for the sake of the
// slot. TestCoreOptionSetsAreOrderedAndReserved still lists it, so that the
// emptiness is recorded rather than mistaken for unfinished work.
//
// ── the settings store is now on the page-render path ────────────────────────
//
// This is the first block whose surface reads the settings store per request,
// and it is worth stating plainly because it changes what
// `stores.enable.settings` costs.
//
// (*Auth).UIConfig reads the store first, before anything else in the document
// (ui_config.go, reproducing ui.router.ts:99), and the stored branding wins over
// the static `ui.branding.*` member by member. It then reads the template store
// for the `config` page's translations. So with the UI on and both stores
// enabled, **every SSR page render and every GET <prefix>/ui/config is two
// DynamoDB reads** — the SETTINGS singleton and the TEMPLATES partition — on top
// of whatever the page's own requests cost. Before this block the settings store
// was read once at cold start, by the seed, and once per POST /2fa/disable.
//
// The failure mode is the one to know about. A settings store that errors does
// not fail the request: the core catches it and serves the reference's own
// fallback document (ui.router.ts:143-161) — default branding, English, no
// translations, and a *shorter* features object carrying three of the eight
// flags, which is upstream's reproduced-not-fixed bug (reference-issues N32).
// A client cannot tell that from success. So the store being unreachable
// degrades every page in the hosted UI to the reference's default look, silently,
// and the only notice is the core's own log line. logUISurface says so at cold
// start rather than leaving it to be discovered.
//
// The other half of that interaction is what the settings store does *not*
// carry here. auth.AuthSettings.UI is the branding the document overrides with,
// and this product seeds none of it: `runtimeSettings` has no `ui` member, and
// declaredRuntimeSettings (settings.go) covers require2fa,
// enabledWebhookActions and lazyEmailVerificationGracePeriodDays. So until the
// admin surface can write it (D8, upstream U15), `settings.UI` is nil on every
// read and uiBranding falls straight through to `ui.branding.*`. The seed and
// the reader do not overlap at all, which is why turning the UI on changes
// nothing about what D3's seeding rule does — only about how often the store it
// seeds is read.
//
// ── the two filesystem seams, in a runtime that has no filesystem ────────────
//
// UIOptions has two fs.FS fields and a Lambda has to answer both.
//
// **Assets** is the reference's uiAssetsDir (ui.router.ts:11-14): the pages and
// scripts the handler serves and renders. nil means the vendored copies, which
// is the reference's own "if not provided, the internal Vanilla JS UI will be
// served" and is what almost every deployment wants — the assets are compiled
// into the binary, so they cost no I/O, no S3 bucket and no cold-start read.
// `ui.assetsDir` is wired anyway, because a deployment that ships its own SPA
// has exactly one place to put it — baked into the artifact, beside the
// configuration document and the mail templates — and os.DirFS over that path is
// the one-line spelling of the reference's directory. The artifact is read-only
// and that is fine: nothing here writes.
//
// A wrong `ui.assetsDir` is refused at cold start (checkUIAssets), and that is
// deliberate rather than defensive. The core takes a host that supplies its own
// asset set at its word and falls back to nothing — "a half-replaced UI is worse
// than a missing one" (UIOptions.Assets) — so a path with a typo in it does not
// degrade, it 404s every page while the deployment reports itself healthy. That
// is the exact shape of silent misconfiguration this product refuses elsewhere.
//
// **Uploads** is the reference's uploadDir (ui.router.ts:16-20), served under
// <prefix>/ui/assets/logo/ and <prefix>/ui/assets/uploads/ (:185-191). **It
// stays nil in this build, and nil now means "the upload store".** See
// uiUploadsFollowTheUploadStore: the core composes the read side from the
// auth.UploadStore the admin surface hands it (auth.WithUploadStore, U15), and
// this field is the override for a host that wants the read side served from
// somewhere else, which this product does not. So `ui.uploadDir` is honoured —
// as an S3 location, admin.go says how — and the two paths serve what the
// console uploaded, through one store rather than two configurations. With no
// store the core's behaviour is the reference's with uploadDir unset: neither
// path is mounted and both answer 404, rather than 500 on a store that is not
// there.
//
// ── the language default the core left to the host ───────────────────────────
//
// UIOptions.DefaultLang is the one field where the port deliberately declined to
// guess and this product has the answer. The reference reads the fallback
// language from `config.email.mailer.defaultLang` (ui.router.ts:103); the core
// has no mailer block on its Config — a mailer there is a transport the host
// builds — so it exposed the knob on UIOptions instead and defaulted it to
// English. This product *does* have `email.mailer.defaultLang`, validated to
// `en` or `it`, so wiring the two together reproduces the reference exactly
// rather than approximately, and an operator who set the mail language does not
// have to discover a second knob that means the same thing.

// uiOptions builds HTTPConfig.UI out of the `ui` block. It is total and does no
// I/O: httpConfig has half a dozen callers that want nothing but Prefix(), and
// every refusal this block can make is made by checkUISupport at cold start.

			// pair into one knob — §1.12 records customLogo and logoUrl as one
			// field, since the reference documents the first and keeps the
			// second only as a legacy spelling — so there is one value to place
			// and the chain resolves to it either way. It goes in LogoURL and

// uiUploadsFollowTheUploadStore is the argument behind UIOptions.Uploads staying
// nil now that there is something to serve, and the record of the deviation it
// retires.
//
// **What the reference does.** `ui.uploadDir` is a directory an administrator's
// uploads are written into by the admin router (admin.router.ts:656) and read
// out of by two express.static mounts, <prefix>/ui/assets/logo/ and
// <prefix>/ui/assets/uploads/ (ui.router.ts:185-191). With the option unset the
// reference mounts neither and both paths 404.
//
// **What this product does.** The same two paths serve the same objects the
// console uploaded, and the knob that names where they live is the same knob —
// spelled as an S3 location, `s3://<bucket>[/<prefix>]`, because a Lambda has
// no directory that survives a request and config-schema.md §1.12 recorded that
// the serverless target would be S3. admin.go builds one auth.UploadStore from
// it and hands it to the core (auth.WithUploadStore); the admin routes write
// through that store, and (*Auth).UIHandler serves the two paths from it
// through auth.UploadFS whenever UIOptions.Uploads is nil (core ui_config.go,
// the precedence on UIOptions.Uploads). So this field is left nil *because*
// the store exists, not in spite of it: filling it would be a second
// configuration of the same objects, and the one host that should fill it is a
// host serving the read side from somewhere the store is not — a snapshot, a
// read-through cache — which this product is not.
//
// **What retired the deviation.** D7 registered
// ui-uploaded-assets-are-not-served with three reasons, and each is answered
// rather than outgrown. *There was no writer*: the four upload routes are the
// writer, mounted by the adapter under <admin>/api/upload. *A directory was the
// wrong noun*: the noun is decided, and a plain path is reported at cold start
// by adminKnobGaps as a spelling this runtime cannot honour, with the s3://
// form as the remedy — accepted rather than refused so a document written for
// another port in the family still loads. *An fs.FS over S3 costs a GetObject
// per Open*: it does, misses included, and the cost is now paid knowingly and
// written down (docs/cost-model.md) rather than avoided by not having the
// feature. The retired entry stays indexed under "Retired" in docs/deviations.md
// so its id keeps resolving.
//
// **What a deployment without a bucket sees.** Exactly the reference's
// unconfigured behaviour, which is why no entry replaces the retired one: with
// `ui.uploadDir` unset, or set to a path, there is no store, the console draws
// no file picker, and both asset paths answer 404 — not 500 — because the core
// leaves an unset Uploads unmounted. A deployment that wants a logo without a
// bucket sets `ui.branding.logoUrl` to a URL it hosts elsewhere, as before.
