// RedactedValue replaces the value of any attribute whose key is on the
// redaction list. It is a constant string rather than "" so that a redacted
// field is visibly redacted in the log, instead of looking like a field the
// caller forgot to set.
const RedactedValue = "[REDACTED]"

// redactedKeys is the explicit deny-list of attribute keys whose values never
// reach stdout. CloudWatch is queryable by anyone with logs:FilterLogEvents,
// which is a far larger set of people than those who may hold a session, so a
// token in a log line is a credential leak with an audit trail attached.
//
// The list is deny-by-key rather than deny-by-value on purpose: a value-shaped
// heuristic ("looks like a JWT") cannot be tested and fails open on the first
// format that was not anticipated, whereas a key that is not on this list is a
// reviewable omission. Every name is matched case-insensitively, and both the
// camelCase wire spelling and the HTTP header spelling are listed where they
// differ, because an attribute may be built from either.
//
// The list grows with the surface. Five credential shapes were added with the
// observability block, and only two of them were missing — which is the point of
// writing down why each is here rather than adding names that look dangerous:
//
//   - `clientSecret` / `client_secret`: the OIDC client's password. The camelCase
//     spelling was already listed; `client_secret` is the snake_case form the
//     token endpoint actually receives, because /token is a form POST in
//     client_secret_post (idp.go, and the discovery document advertises no other
//     method). A key spelled the way the wire spells it is the one an attribute
//     built from the parsed form would carry.
//   - `privateKey`: already listed. idProvider.privateKey is the PEM alternative
//     to the KMS key — the one signing arrangement where this process holds a key
//     it could print (docs/oidc.md §2).
//   - `signature` / `x-webhook-signature`: the HMAC over a webhook body,
//     `X-Webhook-Signature: sha256=<hex>` (awesome-go-auth webhook_sender.go:64,
//     :376). It is not the credential being delivered, it is the proof of
//     authorship: an attacker holding a logged signature plus the body it signed
//     can replay that delivery against the receiver forever, because the receiver
//     verifies exactly those bytes.
//   - `code`: already listed, and it is now carrying more than it was. It is the
//     SMS one-time code AND the OIDC authorization code that /token exchanges for
//     an id_token — single-use, but "single" means "until the first use", and a
//     code in a log is readable before the client gets round to spending it.
//   - `tempToken`: the 2FA step-up handle. wire-contract.md §3 and
//     docs/spec/serverless-gap-analysis.md §1.2 record the reference caveat this
//     product inherited: the tempToken is a *full* access token — same secret,
//     same verifier — so for its five minutes it passes authMiddleware. Logging
//     one is logging a session.

//
// THIS BINARY DOES NOT READ THE HEADER. That is the whole design, and it is a
// change of mind forced by the core: awesome-go-auth v0.9.0 ships the carrier
// (event_context.go), every adapter installs it outermost, and the value it
// reads is published under every Event the core emits. A second parse here would
// produce a second answer to the same question, and the two would be identical
// right up until the day they were not — a host setting HTTPConfig.ClientIP, a
// change in the reference's array-first quirk for a repeated header
// (node-auth auth.router.ts:407-410, ported in EventContextFromRequest), a
// different notion of "absent". So:
//
//	auth.EventContextMiddleware(httpConfig(cfg))   installs it, outermost
//	correlationScope                               copies it onto the logger
//	correlatingTransport                           forwards it outbound
//
// and correlationIDOf below is the only place any of this gets a value from.
// The adapter installs the carrier a second time, further in, for the routes it
// owns; that install recomputes the same function of the same request with the
// same HTTPConfig, so the two cannot disagree by construction rather than by
// agreement. What the outer install adds is coverage: GET /healthz and anything
// else this binary mounts outside the adapter's guard chain.
//
// An absent header stays absent. The core does not mint an id when the caller
// sent none (event_context.go, EventContext.CorrelationID) because an invented
// id joins nothing to anything, and a consumer could not tell it from one the
// caller's gateway assigned — so a request with no header logs no
// correlationId attribute at all, and the absence is the honest answer.
//
// Nothing is echoed back to the caller either. An echo would hand the client a
// value the client just sent, which buys it nothing, and it would put an
// attacker-controlled string into a response header on a credential origin.

// CorrelationIDLogKey is the attribute name every correlated line carries. It is

// caller that sends 10 KB of "correlation id" therefore buys ~5 USD per million
