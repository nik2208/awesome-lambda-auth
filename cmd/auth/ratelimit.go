// The built-in rate limiter: the `rateLimit` block of the schema (§1.16), which
// internal/config/phases.go no longer refuses.
//
// ── this is net-new, and nothing upstream decides any of it ──────────────────
//
// The reference has no rate limiting at all. RouterOptions.rateLimiter
// (auth.router.ts:46) is an empty slot for a host-supplied Express handler;
// absent, the router collapses it to an empty middleware list (rl = [], :468)
// and ships no algorithm, no default and no response shape. So there is no
// behaviour to reproduce here and no upstream to appeal to: every value below is
// a product decision, the spec left every one of them TBD, and the argument for
// each has to be written down because nothing else can be pointed at.
//
// The wire consequence is one refusal the reference never makes, and it is
// registered as the product deviation `rate-limited-routes-answer-429`
// (deviations.go), which quotes the body and the headers verbatim.
//
// ── where it goes, and why the shape of the core's field matters ─────────────
//
// auth.HTTPConfig.RateLimiter is a **constructor**, not a handler. Each adapter
// calls it once per route at mount time — some thirty calls for one mount
// (adapter/nethttp guard) — so the counters have to be created *outside* the
// function this file returns and captured by it. newRateLimiter therefore builds
// the local tier and resolves the route table once and returns a closure over
// them; allocating either inside the returned function would give every route a
// private budget instead of the single shared one the whole design rests on.
//
// The adapter composes it outermost: RateLimiter, then CSRFMiddleware, then the
// auth middleware (adapter/nethttp guard, `auth.RateLimitMiddleware(a.cfg)(auth.CSRFMiddleware(a.cfg)(h))`),
// reproducing the reference's own ordering, where rl is prepended ahead of the
// auth middleware on every route (:541 onwards, GET /me at :656). That order is
// the point of a limiter: a refusal costs nothing downstream — no token
// verified, no store read, no CSRF comparison — and it has one visible
// consequence worth naming, since the CSRF auto-init cookie is distributed by a
// middleware *inside* the chain: a client whose very first request is refused
// receives no csrf-token cookie with the 429. That is correct. A refused request
// is a request the deployment did no work for, and handing out a CSRF token is
// work.
//
// It is applied to every auth route and not to the JWKS document, which the
// adapter registers ahead of the chain. One pair of routes falls *inside* the
// slot here that falls outside it in the reference — the OAuth stubs for an
// unconfigured provider, which the reference registers as bare 404s with no rl
// (:1361-1362, :1407-1408) and which this port mounts as one always-guarded
// handler per route. Behind a limiter at its limit those answer 429 here and 404
// there. That difference belongs to the core, whose HTTPConfig.RateLimiter
// comment names it and whose register carries it; this file does not restate it
// as a product deviation, and the product entry says so rather than leaving the
// reader to wonder. It is also unreachable on a default deployment, because no
// OAuth route is in the default scope.
//
// ── nothing here adds a route ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// This is a middleware and registers no pattern, exactly like docsSecurityHeaders:
// the adapter still owns every path under the api prefix, and the rule that
// nothing in this binary may add one is untouched. What the middleware does
// instead is *match* on the resolved prefix and a table of path suffixes, which
// is the one coupling this file has to the adapter's route table and is pinned
// by TestRateLimitedRoutesAreMountedByTheAdapter.
//
// ── two tiers, and which one is the limit ────────────────────────────────────
//
// **An in-process limiter is not a limiter on this runtime, and that has to be
// said plainly.** A Lambda execution environment serves one request at a time
// and AWS runs as many of them as the arrival rate demands; an in-process
// counter therefore limits each environment separately, so the effective ceiling
// is max × a concurrency nobody chose and nothing reports. An attacker who can
// raise concurrency raises their own budget with it, which is the opposite of a
// limit.
//
// So there are two tiers and only one of them is the limit:
//
//   - **The shared counter** (internal/store/dynamodb rate_limit.go) is the
//     limit. One conditional UpdateItem per request against an item every
//     execution environment shares.
//   - **The local tier** (localRateLimiter below) is a pre-filter in front of
//     it, and never the limit. It holds the same max over the same
//     epoch-aligned window, so it can only ever refuse a request the shared
//     counter would also have refused — it has no false positives by
//     construction — and what it buys is the write: an environment that has
//     already watched a subject exhaust its budget this window refuses locally
//     and spends nothing.
//
// The soundness argument is worth one more line, because it is the only thing
// that makes a local refusal legitimate. The local tier increments only when it
// allows, and every locally-allowed request reaches the shared counter. So by
// the time the local count reaches max, this environment has sent max requests
// that the shared counter either accepted (leaving it at max) or refused
// (meaning it was already at max). Either way the shared counter is at max, and
// the request the local tier is about to refuse would have been refused there
// too.
//
// ── fail open, and what carries the floor ────────────────────────────────────
//
// When the shared counter cannot be reached, the request is **allowed**.
//
// The argument is topological rather than a preference. The counter lives in the
// same DynamoDB table as the user store, so on this product "the limiter cannot
// count" and "the route cannot serve" are the same event: every route in the
// default scope reads or writes that table immediately after the limiter. A
// limiter that failed closed would therefore refuse requests that were going to
// fail anyway, buy nothing, and do real harm twice over — it would convert a
// partial DynamoDB degradation into a total outage on exactly the routes people
// need during one, and it would hide the cause, replacing a 500 that names the
// store with a 429 that blames the caller.
//
// The alternative reading — "an outage becomes an unmetered window" — is the
// cost, and it is bounded rather than accepted whole. A store failure does not
// remove the local tier: it falls back to it, so the ceiling during an outage is
// max per subject per window *per execution environment* instead of max
// outright. That is the honest description of the floor, and it is the one real
// job the local tier has beyond saving writes. It is written down here, in the
// config reference and in the deviation, because a bound that depends on a
// number AWS chooses is not a bound anyone should discover from a bill.
//
// The failure is logged once per cold start, at WARN, and not once per request:
// a limiter that logged every failed write during a DynamoDB incident would add
// its own load to the incident.
//
// ── the subject, and the route that has no email ─────────────────────────────
//
// `rateLimit.keyBy` is `ip` or `email` and defaults to **email**. See
// rateLimitSubject for how a route's subject is resolved, and
// docs/config-reference.md for why the default is not `ip`.
//
// The interesting case is the one the schema does not answer: `keyBy: email` on
// a route whose body carries no email. Three things could be done and two of
// them are wrong. Keying every such request under one sentinel would put them
// all in one partition under one budget — a self-inflicted denial of service an
// attacker triggers on purpose by sending nothing. Skipping the limiter would
// leave POST /2fa/verify, a six-digit code, unlimited, which is the single route
// a limiter is most obviously for. So each route declares an ordered list of
// subject sources and every list ends, implicitly, at the client address:
// `email` where the body has one, the sha256 of the presented `tempToken` where
// it has a challenge instead, and the address otherwise. Nothing in that chain
// verifies anything or reads a store — a hash is not a check — so the refusal
// still costs nothing downstream.

// The exact 429. It is one literal because the deviation register quotes it
// verbatim and rateLimitResponseIsExactlyThis pins it; anything that reassembled
// it from parts would be free to drift from the text an operator was promised.
//
// **The body is the family envelope**, `{error, code}`, because every other
// error this deployment answers is, and a client that already switches on `code`
// needs no new parser for this one. RATE_LIMITED is net-new — the reference has
// no such code, having no limiter — and it is a code rather than a bare `error`
// because the two clients that would act on it (back off, show a wait) must not
// have to match an English sentence.
const rateLimitBody = `{"error":"Too many requests","code":"RATE_LIMITED"}`

// writeRateLimited sends the refusal.
//
// **Retry-After and nothing else.** The obvious companions are the
// RateLimit-Limit / RateLimit-Remaining / RateLimit-Reset family, and they are
// deliberately not sent. The usual objection — that they hand an attacker the
// limit — is weak on its own, because an attacker willing to spend requests
// discovers the limit by reaching it. The decisive one is what
// RateLimit-Remaining would leak on a *successful* response: with `keyBy: email`
// the counter is per account, so a remaining count is an oracle about somebody
// else's traffic. Anyone able to send one request naming victim@example.com
// could read, from a 200, whether that person has been logging in. The headers
// would introduce a side channel that the 429 alone does not have, in exchange
// for a convenience a client can get from Retry-After.
//
// Retry-After itself is sent because it gives away nothing the refusal has not
// already given away — the caller knows they are limited — and because a client
// that backs off correctly is strictly better for everyone, including the
// deployment. It is the delta-seconds form (RFC 9110 §10.2.3), rounded up and
// never below 1: a `Retry-After: 0` is an invitation to retry immediately, which
// is the behaviour this header exists to prevent.
//
// Cache-Control: no-store is one header's insurance against a shared cache in
// front of the API serving one subject's refusal to another. A 429 is not
// heuristically cacheable, so on a correct cache this changes nothing; it is
// here because "correct cache" is an assumption about somebody else's CDN
// configuration and the cost of not assuming is twelve bytes.
//
// No Set-Cookie, by construction rather than by suppression: the limiter is
// outermost, so nothing that sets one has run.

// newAdminPromoteLimiter returns the value for auth.AdminOptions.RateLimiter:
// the console's own limiter slot, which the core applies to exactly one route,
// POST <admin>/users/{id}/promote, ahead of the guard — and to nothing else on
// that surface, the admin login included, on either line (core admin.go,
// AdminOptions.RateLimiter).
//
// ── why the slot is filled, and not left nil ─────────────────────────────────
//
// nil is the reference's own default — the dev line collapses an absent
// rateLimiter to an empty middleware list (node-auth admin.router.ts:577) and
// ships no algorithm — so leaving it nil would be reproducing the reference. It
// is filled anyway, under the same house rule that fills HTTPConfig.RateLimiter:
// a product has to be safe with an empty configuration, and this is the one
// route on the console that changes *who is an administrator*. It runs before
// the guard, so a caller over budget is refused before a token is verified, a
// profile is read or a policy — possibly ListUsers, on 'first-user' — is
// evaluated; that is what makes the slot worth anything against an
// unauthenticated flood at the most privileged write in the deployment.
//
// ── why the auth router's limiter cannot serve it ────────────────────────────
//
// newRateLimiter matches "METHOD /prefix/path" against a table resolved under
// http.apiPrefix, and its subjects are read out of the bodies of the flows
// rateLimit.scope names. This route is under the admin mount, not the prefix,
// carries a path parameter the exact-match table cannot express, and has no
// account-shaped subject in its body — `{method}` names how to promote, not
// whom to count. So it gets its own tier over the same block: rateLimit.max and
// rateLimit.windowSeconds are the budget, rateLimit.enabled is the switch, and
// the shared counter is the same store, under a scope name of its own
// (adminPromoteScope) that no document can spell.
//
// ── the subject is the client address, under either keyBy ────────────────────
//
// rateLimit.keyBy chooses between an address and the account the request is
// *about*, and on the credential flows that account is in the body. Here the
// account the request is about is the path parameter — the person being
// promoted — and keying on it would hand an attacker a fresh budget per victim
// id, which is no limit. The caller's own identity is in a token the limiter
// runs before verifying, and a limiter that trusted an unverified token as a
// key would let the caller mint budgets. What remains is the address the event
// reported, which is what every body-less route under keyBy: email already
// falls back to (rateLimitSubject). The consequence is the one keyBy's own
// argument names: an office behind one NAT shares one budget of ten promotions
// a minute, which for this route is not a hardship.
//
// ── what is deliberately not limited ─────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The admin login. The slot does not cover it and this function does not
// reach past the slot to add one: the dev line leaves POST <admin>/login
// unlimited (node-auth admin.router.ts:614), the core reproduces that and says
// so, and a limiter this binary bolted onto a route the core mounts would be
// the product wrapping a route it does not own. The bound on that route is the
// bcrypt cost of each guess. An operator who wants more puts the console behind
// a network boundary, which is where the reference's own advice for it lives.
//
// Nil when the block is off, which is the reference's behaviour exactly and
// the core's pass-through.
