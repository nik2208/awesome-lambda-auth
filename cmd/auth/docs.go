// The documentation surface: GET <prefix>/openapi.json and GET <prefix>/docs.
//
// Both routes come from the imported adapter and nothing in this file mounts
// either of them. awesome-go-auth v0.7.0 added HTTPConfig.Docs (DocsOptions);
// with Enabled set, all four adapters register the generated OpenAPI document
// and the reference's Swagger UI page — neither guarded, both behind
// CSRFMiddleware — exactly where the reference registers them
// (auth.router.ts:1651-1677; adapter/nethttp/nethttp.go:144-154). What this file
// does is build that DocsOptions out of the product's `docs` block, and nothing
// else.
//
// That division is not a matter of taste. Until v0.7.0 this binary mounted four
// OIDC endpoints of its own; the adapter took them over and the duplicate
// registration killed the cold start inside http.ServeMux. A route that exists
// here and not in the other ports of the family is a wire divergence by
// construction, so the rule is absolute: every path under the api prefix
// belongs to the adapter. The one thing added here is a middleware, which
// registers no pattern — see docsSecurityHeaders.
//
// ── the three-valued knob, and where `auto` is resolved ──────────────────────
//
// `docs.swagger` is `true`, `false` or `auto`, reproducing the reference's
//
//	options.swagger === true || (options.swagger !== false && NODE_ENV !== 'production')
//
// (auth.router.ts:123-131, :1652-1654). DocsOptions.Enabled is a plain bool, and
// the core's own comment says why: "a library whose routes appear and disappear
// with a variable it never sees configured is a library nobody can reason about
// from its own configuration" (awesome-go-auth docs.go), and Go has no NODE_ENV
// to read. Deciding what the ambient environment means is the host's call. This
// binary is the host, so `auto` is resolved here — against
// `deployment.environment`, which this product carries as a first-class knob
// rather than as a process variable, and which defaults to `production`:
//
//	true   both routes mounted, in every environment
//	false  neither route mounted, in every environment
//	auto   mounted if and only if deployment.environment is not "production"
//
// `auto` is also the schema default (internal/config Defaults), so a document
// that mentions neither knob gets neither route: `deployment.environment` is
// `production` until something says otherwise, and `auto` in production is off.
//
// The difference from the reference is exactly that default, and it is already
// registered. NODE_ENV is unset in a fresh Node process and therefore "not
// production", so the reference serves both routes on a stack nobody
// configured, while this product serves neither. That is the
// production-by-default deviation, whose text names swagger as one of the three
// things the default tightens (deviations.go).
//
// ── docs.basePath and DocsOptions.BasePath are the same thing ────────────────
//
// Both are the reference's `swaggerBasePath` (auth.router.ts:133-139, read at
// :1657): the base the served document writes its path items under, and the base
// of the spec URL the Swagger page fetches. Neither moves the mount. The core
// says so in as many words — "It moves the description, never the mount: the two
// routes are always served at HTTPConfig.Prefix(), because that is where the
// adapter is" (awesome-go-auth docs.go) — and it is the *reference's* own doc
// comment, "Base path where the auth router is mounted", that misleads: that
// value never mounts anything there either, it only builds spec paths and the
// page's url.
//
// So this is a pass-through and not a translation, and the defaults agree as
// well. internal/config derives `docs.basePath` from `http.apiPrefix` when the
// document leaves it unset (load.go, derive — which is why checkPhaseGaps has to
// inherit the http block, as phases.go records), and the core reads an empty
// BasePath as HTTPConfig.Prefix(). Both sides normalise through
// HTTPConfig.Prefix(), so "/auth", "/auth/" and "auth" are one value on either
// side of the seam.
//
// What a pass-through cannot check is whether the operator meant it. A base path
// that differs from the api prefix makes this deployment serve a document
// describing paths it does not answer: correct behind a reverse proxy that maps
// one onto the other, and a silent lie anywhere else. logDocsSurface names it at
// cold start rather than refusing it, because the proxy case is the reason the
// knob exists.
//
// ── the Swagger page puts a third-party script on the auth origin ────────────
//
// The page is the reference's, reproduced byte for byte by the core, and it
// loads swagger-ui-dist@5 from the unpkg CDN with no subresource integrity
// (swaggerUIHTML in awesome-go-auth docs.go; openapi.ts:1646-1669). Whatever
// unpkg serves then runs same-origin with this deployment's cookies — the CSRF
// cookie included, which is readable from JavaScript by design, because the
// double-submit pattern requires the client to read it. Upstream registered
// docs-routes-are-opt-in partly for this, and its advice is "Keep the routes off
// in production, or serve them behind a Content-Security-Policy that pins that
// CDN".
//
// Three things follow, and one that deliberately does not.
//
// **This product does not refuse to start.** The obvious rule — `docs.swagger:
// true` with `deployment.environment: production` is an RS-13 — was written and
// then thrown away, over what the core's switch actually controls. Serving a
// spec document and serving a Swagger page are separable things: the first is a
// machine-readable description that a client generator or a gateway consumes and
// that carries no script at all; the second is the page with the CDN on it.
// DocsOptions.Enabled is one bool for both, and every adapter mounts both under
// it (adapter/nethttp/nethttp.go:151-154). This binary cannot mount the spec
// route on its own, because nothing here may add a route under the api prefix,
// and it will not fork the core to split the flag. A refusal aimed at the page
// would therefore take the document with it and refuse a production deployment
// for wanting the harmless half of an inseparable pair — leaving the operator
// with one move, turning both off, which is the state they were trying to leave.
//
// The house rule that would otherwise apply — "forgetting to name the
// environment should tighten, not loosen" — is already satisfied, and satisfied
// by the part of the design that handles *forgetting*: `production` is the
// default environment and `auto` is the default knob, so silence gets neither
// route. Reaching the hazard takes two deliberate statements in one document.
// RS-3 and RS-12 refuse configurations that are broken; this one works, and is a
// risk an operator may knowingly take on an internal stack. The upstream fix is
// a second field — a spec-only mode, or a page served from assets the library
// vendors instead of a CDN — and it is reported as such rather than worked
// around here.
//
// **It warns, once, at deploy time.** internal/config's collectWarnings raises
// `docs.swagger` when the page is served in production, naming the CDN and the
// cookie it can read. A warning there rather than a log line here because
// Config.Warnings() is what the deployment tooling reads *before* an upload, so
// the operator hears it before the stack has it.
//
// **It sends a Content-Security-Policy on both routes**, which is the one thing
// this binary can do about the hazard without touching a route. See
// docsSecurityHeaders for what that buys and — more important — what it does
// not.
//
// **And it keeps the two routes together.** The product does not gate them
// separately even though it could refuse one in middleware, because the served
// document describes both paths (OpenAPIInfo.Docs), so a deployment answering
// one and 404ing the other would publish a document that lies about its own
// surface.

// docsCDNOrigin is the single third-party origin the reference's Swagger page
// loads from. It is a transcription of a literal in the core's HTML, not a knob:
// the page is the reference's byte for byte, so there is nothing here to
// configure and nothing upstream to negotiate with.
//
// TestDocsPolicyCoversEveryOriginTheCorePageLoads renders that HTML and fails if
// it ever names an origin this constant does not, which is the tripwire for an
// upstream change that would otherwise turn the policy below into a silently
// broken page.
const docsCDNOrigin = "https://unpkg.com"

// docsPageCSP is the policy sent with GET <prefix>/docs.
//
// 'unsafe-inline' is unavoidable on both script and style. The page carries an
// inline <script> that calls SwaggerUIBundle (openapi.ts:1655-1666) and
// swagger-ui injects stylesheets at runtime; a nonce or a hash would mean
// rewriting the core's HTML, and a page that differs from the reference's is a
// page whose behaviour a deployment has to re-verify. The CDN origin is listed
// on img-src and font-src for the same reason: swagger-ui.css resolves its own
// assets relative to itself, and a policy that breaks the page is a policy an
// operator turns off.

// docsSecurityHeaders decorates the two documentation responses with a
// Content-Security-Policy and the two headers that go with it.
//
// It is a middleware over the whole mux that acts on exactly two paths, and that
// shape is the point: it registers no pattern, so the adapter still owns the
// surface and the rule against adding a route under the api prefix is untouched.
// It matches on the resolved prefix and the core's own path constants, so a
// customised http.apiPrefix moves the policy with the routes, and an upstream
// change to either path moves it too.
//
// **What the policy buys, exactly.** It does not make an untrusted CDN safe. A
// compromised bundle still executes same-origin, can still read document.cookie,
// and can still put what it read into a top-level navigation, which no CSP
// directive in any shipping browser prevents. What the policy removes are the
// quiet channels: fetch and XHR to anywhere but this origin, an image beacon, a
// form post, a nested frame, a rewritten <base>. It also refuses to be framed,
// which closes the other half of the hazard — a docs page embedded in a hostile
// document. So it turns a silent exfiltration into one that navigates the
// operator's own browser away from the page: noisier, and far less useful
// against a route only an operator visits. The fix that would actually close it
// is upstream, and is named in the file header.
//
// Off when the routes are not mounted, because a policy on a 404 is a claim
// about a surface this deployment does not have, and because an operator reading
