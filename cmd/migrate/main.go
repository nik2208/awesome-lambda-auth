// Command migrate imports users from another identity provider into this
// deployment's table.
//
//	migrate cognito --user-pool-id <id> --table <name> --region <region> \

//
// It is an operator tool, run from a workstation or a pipeline, and it is
// deliberately not part of the deployed artifact: nothing about it belongs on a
// Lambda's critical path, it wants credentials for two accounts at once, and a
// bulk import that could be triggered by an HTTP request would be a route this
// product is not allowed to have.
//
// # What it does and does not carry
//
// It carries the records. It cannot carry the passwords, because a Cognito user
// pool yields no password hash to anybody, ever — that is the point of a managed
// directory. Every imported row therefore lands with an EMPTY passwordHash and a
// migration marker, and the passwords are collected one at a time afterwards, on
// each person's next login, through the password-verifier seam in
// internal/store/migrating. Running this command is the first half of a
// migration; the second half is people logging in.
//
// # Resumability, which matters more than speed here
//
// A bulk import runs against somebody else's API over somebody else's network,
// so it will be interrupted. Three decisions make an interruption cheap, and
// each of them is argued where it is implemented:
//
//   - A user that already exists locally is SKIPPED, never overwritten
//     (importUser). Re-running the whole command is therefore always safe, and
//     is the recommended way to recover from anything.
//   - A paging failure stops the run and PRINTS THE RESUME TOKEN of the last
//     page that completed, which --start-token takes (run). Nothing is lost
//     either way, because of the previous point; the token only saves time.
//   - A record with no email address is SKIPPED AND REPORTED, and the run
//     continues (importUser). One unusable record in a pool of forty thousand
//     must not end the import, and it must not be silently dropped either.
//
// The exit status says which of those happened: 0 when every record was written
// or skipped as already present, 1 when any record could not be imported, so a
// pipeline notices without having to parse the summary.
