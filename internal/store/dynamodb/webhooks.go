// This file implements the three webhook stores of core v0.8.0: WebhookStore
// (FindByEvent, the only mandatory one), WebhookAdminStore and
// InboundWebhookStore.
//
// One item per subscription, in one directory partition:
//
//	PK=WEBHOOKS  SK=WHK#<id>
//
// Modelled on the template directory (templates.go) and for its reasons. The
// set is bounded and administrator-authored, every read of it is a
// whole-partition Query, and keeping it in the main table rather than behind a
// GSI makes those reads strongly consistent — so the admin who just saved a
// subscription sees it in the next listing, which an eventually-consistent index
// would turn into a lost edit they would report as a bug.
//
// The sort key's tail is the store-assigned id, which means a configuration is
// addressable by the id UpdateWebhook and RemoveWebhook carry, with no second
// pointer item. The price is the listing order; see below.
//
// # FindByEvent is the only filter in the delivery chain
//
// The core is explicit and the consequence is severe: the emit path hands every
// configuration this method returns straight to the sender, which re-checks
// neither isActive nor events. **A store that over-returns delivers.** So the
// three rules — active only, tenant scope, event match — are applied by
// WebhookConfig.Matches, the exported helper the core supplies for exactly this,
// rather than re-derived here. Re-deriving them is how the wildcard, the
// empty-events case and the global-webhook case drift per backend, and the drift
// is invisible until a webhook fires for the wrong tenant.
//
// The same caller swallows a store failure with .catch(() => []), so an error
// from FindByEvent means "no webhooks for this event" and never a failed emit.
// Returning an error is therefore not a way to refuse an event; an empty slice
// is.
//
// # Why the tenant is matched in memory, and why that is not a §3 violation
//
// §3's rule is that tenant isolation is a property of the key and never of a
// filter. It is not bent here, because a webhook's TenantID is not an isolation
// boundary: an empty one means *global*, a subscription that fires for every
// tenant, so the predicate FindByEvent needs is "mine **or** global" and no
// single partition key expresses a disjunction. The rule exists to stop one
// tenant's *user data* being reachable from another tenant's query; this is
// deployment configuration an administrator writes, the whole set is read as one
// Query by design, and the core ships Matches precisely so that stores do this
// in memory. §3 is amended to say so rather than left to look violated.
//
// # Ordering: the one deviation
//
// The core's normative order is first-insertion, which MemoryWebhookStore
// guarantees and which this design cannot reproduce: a Query returns a partition
// in sort-key order, and the sort key's tail is a random id. So all three
// readers — FindByEvent, ListWebhooks and FindByProvider — answer in **id**
// order, and CompatibilityNotes registers it, exactly as it registers the
// template directory's id order against MemoryTemplateStore's insertion order.
//
// The alternative was a creation-timestamp sort key, which would have been
// insertion order in all but pathological cases and would have cost a by-id
// pointer item for the two methods that carry only an id. It was rejected
// because "insertion order except when two land in the same nanosecond or the
// clock steps backwards" is a deviation that has to be registered *anyway*, and
// a registered order that is simply "by id" is one a reader can predict.

// Webhook attributes. They are the reference's JSON key names verbatim
// (WebhookConfig's tags), so a stored subscription round-trips between this port
// and a node-auth deployment unchanged — the same bargain the settings document
// strikes. `isActive` is shared with the tenant and API key items (tenants.go).
