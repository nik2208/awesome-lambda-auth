// auth.AuthCodeStore: the OIDC authorization codes the IdP mints at /authorize
// and spends at /token (data-model.md §1.7), one item per code at
// OIDC#<sha256(code)> / CODE.
//
// The core's default for this store is a process-local map, and its own comment
// says what that costs here: "correct only while both endpoints are served by
// the same process: a serverless runtime or any deployment with more than one
// instance must supply a shared implementation, or /token will answer
// invalid_grant for every code minted by a sibling process" (store.go,
// IDPConfig.Codes). Under Lambda every invocation may be a different execution
// environment, so the map is not a degraded option, it is a broken one. This is
// the shared implementation.
//
// ── why the record is the item ───────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Unlike the four single-use token families, an authorization code is not an
// attribute pair on a user profile: it is a record of its own — client, redirect
// URI, nonce, scope, PKCE challenge — with no natural owner to hang it off, and
// it is looked up by a hash that carries no tenant. So the hash is the partition
// key and the whole record is the item, which is also what makes ConsumeCode a
// single conditional DeleteItem.
//
// ── why a replay and an expiry are the same answer ───────────────────────────
//
// ConsumeCode answers auth.ErrInvalidCode for a code that never existed, one
// that has already been redeemed and one whose deadline has passed. That is not
// laziness about error mapping: the three are the same fact — this code cannot
// be exchanged — and any difference between them is an oracle. A caller who
// could tell "expired" from "never existed" could probe which codes were issued;
// a caller who could tell "already redeemed" from "expired" would learn that the
// code they stole had been used, which is the one thing an attacker holding a
// leaked code wants to know. The core's handler maps every error to the same
// 400 invalid_grant (idp.go), so nothing on the wire is lost either way.
//
// ── single use ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// ConsumeCode is a conditional DeleteItem with ALL_OLD, through the same
// consumeItemOnce primitive PendingLinkStore.Get uses, and the expiry is part of
// the condition rather than a check after the read. Exactly one of any number of
// concurrent redemptions can satisfy it, which is the guarantee RFC 6749 §4.1.2
// asks for ("the authorization code MUST NOT be used more than once") and the
// one a read-then-delete cannot provide: two Lambdas racing on a stolen code
// would both pass the read and both mint a session.

// Options.NonAtomicSingleUseTokens does not reach this store, and that is
// deliberate. The flag exists to reproduce the reference's read-then-clear for
// strict-parity testing, and the reference has no authorization server and no
// authorization codes to be strict about; the core's interface, meanwhile,
// requires the atomic form in so many words ("a conditional delete, a row lock,
// or a DEL-and-check pipeline, not a read followed by a delete"). There is
// nothing to be compatible with and a guarantee to keep, so there is no switch.
