// This file implements the shared counter behind the built-in rate limiter
// (data-model.md §1.5 row #61): one item per (scope, subject, window), advanced
// by a single conditional UpdateItem per request.
//
// It is the only store in this package that implements no awesome-go-auth
// interface. The reference has no rate limiting at all — RouterOptions.rateLimiter
// is an empty slot a host drops an Express handler into, and absent it the
// router collapses to rl = [] (auth.router.ts:46, :468) — so there is no
// upstream contract to satisfy and no type assertion to survive. cmd/auth
// discovers AllowRequest structurally, which is what rateLimitCounter below
// pins.
//
// ── why the counter cannot live in the process ───────────────────────────────
//
// A Lambda execution environment serves one request at a time and AWS runs as
// many of them as the arrival rate demands. An in-process counter therefore
// limits each environment separately: under any concurrency worth limiting, the
// effective ceiling is the configured max multiplied by a number nobody chose
// and nothing reports. That is not a loose limit, it is no limit — an attacker
// who can raise concurrency raises their own budget with it. So the limit is a
// row in the table every environment shares, and the in-process tier in cmd/auth
// is a pre-filter in front of this one, never the limit itself.
//
// ── the item, and why it is a fixed window ───────────────────────────────────
//
// PK=RL#<scope>#<subject>#<window>, SK=RL, with the window index — wall-clock
// seconds divided by the window length — inside the partition key. A window
// therefore has its own item, a past window is unreachable rather than stale,
// and there is nothing to reset: the next window starts at zero because it
// starts at a key nothing has written yet.
//
// That is a fixed window and it has the property every fixed window has: the
// boundary is a seam. A subject may spend its whole budget in the last instant
// of one window and its whole budget again in the first instant of the next, so
// the true worst case over a sliding window of the same length is 2×max, not
// max. This is accepted rather than worked around, and the reasons are in that
// order:
//
//   - A sliding window or a token bucket needs the request history, or a
//     timestamp plus a fractional balance, which means a read-modify-write or a
//     much larger conditional expression. Both cost more than one write per
//     request, on the login path, forever.
//   - The bound this limiter exists for is "an attacker cannot make unlimited
//     guesses", and 2×max per window is as much a bound as max is. A factor of
//     two does not change what a 10-per-minute limit does to a credential
//     stuffing run.
//   - The seam is only reachable by an attacker who knows where the boundary is
//     and is willing to idle up to it. They can learn it — a refusal's
//     Retry-After names it — and it buys them one extra window's budget, once.
//
// docs/config-reference.md says the same thing to the operator, because the one
// thing a fixed window must not be is a surprise.
//
// ── what one request costs ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// One UpdateItem against an item well under 1 KB: **1 WCU per limited request**,
// allowed or refused. A refused request costs the same write as an allowed one —
// DynamoDB bills a conditional write whose condition fails — and that is the
// cost the in-process pre-filter exists to remove: an environment that has
// already watched a subject exhaust its budget in this window refuses locally
// and writes nothing.
//
// The condition is attribute_not_exists(n) OR n < :max, so a refused request
// does not increment. The counter is bounded by max however long the flood
// lasts, which matters for a reason beyond tidiness: an unbounded counter would
// let an attacker push n arbitrarily high, and any later feature that compared
// against it — a progressive delay, a lockout — would inherit an
// attacker-controlled number.
//
// ── the hot partition, and why keyBy defaults to email ───────────────────────
//
// One (scope, subject, window) is one partition key, and a partition key is
// capped at 1 000 WCU. With keyBy: ip that is mostly a feature — a single
// abusive source throttles itself — but a large NAT or corporate egress shares
// one key with every legitimate user behind it, so the limiter becomes the
// outage for exactly the people it is not aimed at (data-model.md §2.3). It is
// why this product's keyBy defaults to email, where the partition is one account
// and the write rate is one person's login attempts, and it is how §2.3's own
// conclusion — "per-IP windows must therefore be short and the account-scoped
// limiter must be the primary control" — is honoured rather than merely quoted.

// Rate-limit key space. The window index is the trailing segment and is always a
// decimal integer, so the split at the last separator is unambiguous however odd
// the subject is — which is what lets the subject occupy a middle segment
// without the '#'-free rule checkProvider needs.
const (
	// pkRateLimitPrefix keys one counter (data-model.md §2.2). The subject is
	// written as it is — an address, or a client IP — for the same reason
	// EMAIL#<t>#<email> is: this table already keys items by address, so nothing
	// here is a new class of stored data, and an operator debugging "why is this
	// person being refused" can find the item. It is unreadable without table
	// access and gone within two windows of the last request.
	pkRateLimitPrefix = "RL" + keySep

	// skRateLimit is the single sort key of the partition. The partition holds
	// exactly one item, so the sort key is a constant, as SESSION's and PLINK's
	// are; there is nothing to name because there is nothing to distinguish.
	skRateLimit = "RL"
)

// typeRateLimit is the counter's _t (data-model.md §7). Its own type because a
// migration sweep over these has nothing in common with a sweep over anything
// else in the table: they are the only items here that are pure counters, owned
// by no user, referenced by no other item and read by nothing.
const typeRateLimit = "ratelimit"

// attrRateLimitCount is the counter itself. One letter deliberately: it is
// written on every limited request and DynamoDB bills an attribute name as part
// of the item on every one of them.
const attrRateLimitCount = "n"

// maxRateLimitSubjectLen bounds the subject segment, for the reason
// maxEmailKeyLen exists: DynamoDB's own limit is 2 048 bytes for a partition
// key, and an attacker who chooses the subject — which on an email-keyed limiter
// they do, by putting whatever they like in the request body — must not be able
// to turn that into an opaque ValidationException on the login path. 320 is the
// longest address RFC 5321 permits and is the cap EMAIL# already uses.
const maxRateLimitSubjectLen = 320

// rateLimitTTLGrace is how long past the end of its window a counter is kept
// before TTL may reap it.
//
// Nothing reads a counter after its window ends — the window index is inside the
// partition key, so a past item is not stale but unreachable — which means the
// grace is not protecting a read, as the session grace is. It covers clock skew
// between execution environments, so two Lambdas a few seconds apart agree on
// which item they are advancing rather than one of them writing into a window
// the other has already had reaped. Five minutes is far more skew than AWS's
// clocks show and costs nothing: TTL deletion is free and the item is ~100 bytes.
const rateLimitTTLGrace = 5 * time.Minute

// ErrInvalidRateLimitSubject means a caller handed the limiter a subject that
// cannot be turned into a key: empty, longer than maxRateLimitSubjectLen, or
// carrying a control character.
//
// It is a typed refusal rather than a silent substitution because both available
// substitutions are wrong. Putting a constant in place of a bad subject would
// place every such request in one partition under one budget, which is a
// self-inflicted denial of service an attacker triggers on purpose by sending
// nonsense. Skipping the limiter would let the same nonsense buy an unlimited
// route. cmd/auth answers it by falling back to the client address, which is a
// real subject it always has and never takes from the request body.
var ErrInvalidRateLimitSubject = errors.New("dynamodb: invalid rate-limit subject")

// ErrInvalidRateLimitScope means the scope segment is not a usable key segment.
// It occupies a middle segment of the partition key, exactly as an OAuth
// provider name does, so a '#' inside it would let one scope forge another's
// counter — and idPattern is the same answer here that it is there.

// rateLimitCounter is the shape cmd/auth discovers structurally, pinned here so
// that a signature which drifts is a build failure in this package rather than a
// limiter that silently stops being found and a deployment that silently stops
// being limited — the same argument interfaces.go makes for the stores the core
// discovers by type assertion.
//
// It is deliberately in this file and not in interfaces.go. That file is one
// central block of assertions and is being broken up into one assertion per
// store file; putting this one where its method is is where that refactor is
// heading, and it keeps this block out of its way.

// AllowRequest advances the counter for one request and reports whether it may
// proceed.
//
// scope is the endpoint group the limiter was pointed at, subject is whatever
// the deployment keys by — an address, or a client IP — max is the budget for
// one window and window is the window length. The returned duration is the time
// remaining in the current window, which is what a refusal's Retry-After is
// built from; it is meaningless when the request was allowed.
//
// It is one conditional UpdateItem and nothing else: no read, no transaction, no
// second call. Two invocations racing on the last unit of a budget cannot both
