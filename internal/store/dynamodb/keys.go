// /link-request" (oauth_wire.go:170-174) — and both are written by the core
// (oauth_wire.go:485, :710) and read exactly once (:530, :765).

// The third namespace the core knows about, "pending-link:", is deliberately not
// here. It is the host-written account-conflict stash, and LinkRequest *reads* it
// to resolve an identity (oauth_wire.go:689) while LinkVerify deletes it only
// after the link has been written (:804). Consuming it on read would make an
// ordinary retry of POST /link-request — a user whose mail never arrived, or a
// first attempt that failed its own GetUserByEmail — answer 401 UNAUTHORIZED
// instead of issuing a second token.
//

// behaviour (oauth_wire.go:871-884). That is the safe default for an unknown
// namespace in one direction and the unsafe one in the other: failing to consume a
// new single-use kind loses an atomicity guarantee the reference never had, where
// consuming a new re-readable kind would silently break a working flow. The
