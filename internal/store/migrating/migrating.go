// Package migrating wraps the DynamoDB user store with the two halves of a
// migration off another identity provider: a lookup that can fall through to the
// old directory, and the marker that decides which accounts the login path is
// still allowed to ask about.
//
// # What a migration is here
//
// Two things have to cross, and they cross by different routes because one of
// them cannot be copied.
//
// The records cross in bulk, through cmd/migrate, which pages the source
// directory and writes each user with CreateUser. The passwords do not cross at
// all: a user pool hands out no password hash, by design, so there is nothing to
// import. They are collected one at a time instead, on the next login each
// person performs, through the core's password-verifier seam — the old directory
// is asked whether the password is right, and if it is, the core hashes it
// locally and never asks again (awesome-go-auth/password_verifier.go). A
// migration is finished when the last person has logged in once, and the
// operator can watch that happen by counting the rows that still carry a marker.
//
// # The marker, and why everything keys on it
//
// Every imported row carries `migration = {source, pool}` — a profile attribute
// on the DynamoDB item. It is the answer to "may this account's password be sent
// to Cognito", and the upstream seam requires a verifier to ask that question
// before it does anything else, for two reasons that both bind this package:
//
//   - The hook is reached by every login whose stored hash failed to verify,
//     which is wider than the imported rows. An account that never had a
//     password — OAuth-only, magic-link-only — carries an empty hash, so its
//     failed logins arrive too, carrying whatever plaintext the request held.
//   - The hook sits on an unauthenticated route. A verifier that calls the
//     source for any address it is handed turns POST /login into an amplifier
//     aimed at that source, and at its lockout counters, for every address an
//     attacker cares to name.
//
// The marker is also checked against the *configured* pool, not merely for
// presence. A stack repointed at a second pool must not start asking the new
// pool about accounts imported from the first: the answer would be "no such
// user" for all of them, which is harmless, and the traffic would not be.
//
// It never travels on auth.User. The profile read files it on the request
// context and the verifier takes it from there, because auth.NewPublicUser
// serialises everything on auth.User and GET <prefix>/me is that projection
// unwrapped — a marker on the record would name the source directory and the
// user pool id to whoever holds a session on a not-yet-migrated account.
// internal/store/dynamodb/migration.go argues the carrier and cites the core
// line that makes it correct; this package is its only consumer. The
// consequence here is one rule with no exception: a verifier that cannot find a
// marker for the user it was handed answers no. There is no fallback to reading
// Metadata, because a fallback is how the disclosure would come back.
//
// # What dual-read costs
//
// In dual-read mode a GetUserByEmail miss falls through to AdminGetUser and
// lazily creates the local row. That is one call to Cognito per miss, and
// GetUserByEmail is reached from POST /login, /register, /forgot-password,
// /magic-link/send and /sms-code/send — all unauthenticated, all taking an
// address straight from the request body. So the cost is exactly the cost the
// verifier's marker gate exists to prevent, arriving through the other door,
// and the same reasoning applies to it:
//
//   - It is off by default. import-only is the default mode, and the runbook
//     says to turn dual-read off once the bulk import has been verified. The
//     mode exists for the window in which the import is incomplete, not for the
//     life of the deployment.
//   - It is rate-limited, per address and globally, by the same limiter the
//     verifier uses (limiter.go). Over budget, the miss stays a miss.
//   - It never changes what the route answers. A fall-through that fails — the
//     limiter refused, the pool does not know the address, the call errored —
//     returns the original ErrUserNotFound, never a new error, so a client
//     cannot tell a dual-read deployment from an import-only one by anything on
//     the wire. There is a timing difference and it is not equalised; see
//     GetUserByEmail.
//
// A negative cache was considered and refused. Remembering "this address is not
// in the pool" would collapse repeated misses for one address to a single call,
// but the per-address bucket already does that, and a cache with a lifetime is a
// user-enumeration oracle with a lifetime: the second lookup of an address is
// fast or slow depending on what the first one found. The global bucket is the
// bound that matters for distinct addresses, and a cache does nothing for those.
//
// # What this package does not do
//
// It does not fork or replace anything the core owns. The password is adopted by
// the core, hashed at Config.BcryptCost and written through
// UserPasswordStore.UpdatePassword; the marker is dropped by that same write
// (internal/store/dynamodb/tokens.go). Nothing here mints a token, answers a
// route or adds a status code, and with the block unconfigured none of it is
// constructed at all.

// GetUserByEmail resolves locally first and, in dual-read mode only, falls a

//
// Three properties, each pinned by a test:
//
//   - A hit never reaches the source. The migration is invisible to every
//     account already imported, which after the bulk import is all of them.
//   - A store failure that is not a miss is returned as itself. Falling through
//     on a timeout or a throttle would turn a transient DynamoDB problem into a
//     provisioning run against Cognito, and could create a duplicate row for a
//     user the table already holds and merely failed to return.
//   - A failed fall-through returns the ORIGINAL miss. Not the limiter's
//     refusal, not the directory's error, not a wrapped anything: the core maps
//     a GetUserByEmail error to ErrInvalidCredentials without reading it
//     (login_2fa.go), so any error works on the login path — but /register
//     branches on ErrUserExists versus a miss, and a novel error there would be
//     a 500 where the route used to answer a 201. The original error is the only
//     value that is right on every route that calls this.
//
// What is not equalised is time. A miss that falls through costs a network round
// trip that a local hit does not, on an unauthenticated route, so a client that
// measures can tell "this address is in neither place" from "this address is
// local" — and, more sharply, can tell "in the pool" from "in neither". That
// signal is not created here: the login path never equalised, an unknown address
// returns before any bcrypt work while a known one pays a compare
// (awesome-go-auth/login_2fa.go), and the upstream seam says in as many words
// that equalising what a host adds is the host's job and not the library's. What
// this package does about it is bound it — the limiter caps how many
// measurements an attacker gets — and turn it off by default. It is a statement
// of posture, not a pinned property, and the runbook says so.
