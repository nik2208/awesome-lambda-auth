// checkRS13Migration: a migration block must describe a migration that can
// actually happen.
//
// Not a §2 rule, because §2 was extracted from a reference that has no
// migration of any kind; it takes the next free identifier for the reason
// RuleMigrationIncomplete gives. Every clause below is a combination of
// individually valid values whose failure would otherwise be discovered from a
// person's failed login rather than from a failed deploy, which is the test
// every rule in this table has to pass.
//
// The clauses, and what each of them is actually preventing:
//
//   - A knob set with no source. The source is the off switch, so a pool id, an
//     app client or dual-read written without one is a block that reads as
//     configured and does nothing. This is the shape of an operator who turned
//     the migration off by deleting the wrong line, and the one clause where the
//     deployment would otherwise come up looking healthy while the migration it
//     was redeployed to perform is silently not running.
//
//   - A source with no pool id, and a pool id with no region. Both are the same
//     failure seen twice: a directory this deployment cannot address. Without a
//     region in particular, the SDK resolves AWS_REGION — this stack's own
//     region — and a pool that lives in the account being migrated out of would
//     answer "no such user" for every person, indistinguishably from an empty
//     pool. The region is therefore demanded rather than inherited from
//     stores.connection.region: they are the same value only by coincidence.
//
//   - dual-read on a driver that cannot hold the marker. Falling a miss through
//     to the source is only worth anything if the row it creates is still there
//     on the next request, and on the memory driver it is not: each execution
//     environment would re-provision the same person from Cognito, forever, on
//     an unauthenticated route. That is the amplifier the whole marker design
//     exists to prevent, reintroduced by a store choice.
//
//   - A verifier configured with no store that can adopt the password. This is
//     the clause the upstream seam asks for by name. With a client id set, a
//     login reaches the verifier, the verifier answers ok=true migrated=true,
//     and the core then requires the user store to be a UserPasswordStore or it
//     answers a generic 500 (awesome-go-auth/password_verifier.go). It also
//     requires the marker to have survived the write, which is the same
//     capability. Refusing here turns a 500 per migrating login into a failed

// signed state is the reference's own behaviour and not a broken deployment.
//
// The allowlist half is this product's, and it closes the second half of
// reference-issues N1. The callback decides where to send the browser by
// reading the origin out of the `state` it is handed and checking it against
// the redirect allowlist — email.siteUrls merged with http.cors.origins

// that carries a fresh session in a Set-Cookie, so a state pointing at an
// attacker's origin turns a successful login into a redirect the victim's
// browser follows with the flow's own credentials already in the jar.
//
// The core signs its states, which is why it can reproduce the reference's
// empty-allowlist behaviour safely for an embedder. A deployment is a different
// thing: it also has to survive the day the signing secret is the thing that
