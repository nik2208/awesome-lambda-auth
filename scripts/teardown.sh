#
# A quickstart you cannot cleanly delete is a trap, and "delete the stack" is
# not by itself a clean delete. Three things outlive it:
#
#   1. DynamoDB deletion protection, if it was turned on. The stack delete fails
#      on the table and rolls back, leaving everything else in place.
#   2. The two generated signing secrets. CloudFormation does not delete a
#      Secrets Manager secret — it *schedules* the deletion with a recovery
#      window of up to 30 days, and the name stays reserved for that long.
#      Harmless here (the template lets Secrets Manager pick the names), but the
#      secrets are billed monthly until the window expires.
#   3. The S3 artifact bucket, which the stack does not own at all.
#
# This script names all three and handles each behind an explicit flag rather
# than deleting anything the user did not ask for.

usage: scripts/teardown.sh --profile <profile> --region <region> [options]

required:
  --profile <name>                 AWS CLI profile. No default, on purpose.
  --region  <name>                 AWS region. No default, on purpose.

options:
  --stack-name <name>              Stack to delete (default: awesome-lambda-auth)
  --disable-deletion-protection    Turn DynamoDB deletion protection off first.
                                   Needed only if you deployed with
                                   EnableDeletionProtection=true.
  --purge-secrets                  After the stack is gone, force-delete the two
                                   generated signing secrets immediately instead
                                   of leaving them in the 30-day recovery
                                   window. IRREVERSIBLE. Only ever do this to a
                                   stack whose data you are also discarding —
                                   without those secrets every issued token is
                                   unverifiable.
  --delete-artifact-bucket [name]  Empty and delete the deploy bucket. Defaults
                                   to the name deploy.sh computes.
  --yes                            Skip the confirmation prompt.
  -h, --help                       This.

What the stack delete removes on its own: the DynamoDB table AND ALL USER DATA
IN IT (the template leaves DeletionPolicy at Delete so a quickstart is
disposable), the Lambda function and its execution role, the HTTP API, and the
CloudWatch log group with every log line in it. Point-in-time recovery does not
survive the table; export or back up first if any of it matters.
