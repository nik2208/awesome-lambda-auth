# The arch-suffixed name is canonical, and the default build is also copied to
# dist/auth-lambda.zip, which is the CodeUri infra/sam/template.yaml resolves.
# Two names rather than one arch-less name: `aws cloudformation package` needs a
# fixed path, and a build that silently overwrote the arm64 artifact with an
# amd64 one under the same name would be deployed without anyone noticing.
#
# The target runtime is provided.al2023, which starts the executable it finds at
# the root of the archive named exactly `bootstrap` — not cmd/auth, not auth.
#
# Reproducibility, in the sense that matters here (the same source produces a
# byte-identical zip):
#   - The compiler runs in a pinned image, so the Go version is fixed.
#   - CGO is off, so nothing links against the build host's libc.
#   - -trimpath removes the build directory from the binary, and
#     -buildvcs=false keeps the VCS stamp (commit, dirty flag, build time) out
#     of it, since a stamp differs between two builds of the same tree.
#   - -ldflags "-s -w" drops the symbol table and DWARF: smaller cold starts,
#     and one less source of variation.
#   - The zip entry is written with a fixed timestamp and fixed permissions,
#     because zip stores the file mtime and would otherwise change on every run.
